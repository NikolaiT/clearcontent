Clearcontent
============

A basic but mighty wordpress theme built on <a href="http://underscores.me/">underscores</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap 3</a>.

### To whom it may concern

Clearcontent is not (and will probably never) be intended to serve as a public theme. I use it for my [blog](http://incolumitas.com "The authors blog")
as well as to learn some basic webdesign. Therefore all features are heavily experimental and maybe unstable. There is also incolumitas.com specific, hard-coded functionality which is not (yet) customizable.

I will maybe make this theme in the future official.
